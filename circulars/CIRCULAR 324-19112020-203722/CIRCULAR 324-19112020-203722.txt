<h1>Welcome to OneStop Dashboard!</h1><p>Project for Geek-<a />-Hertz 2020 Web Coding Hackathon Created by Aaditya Rengarajan and Shreya Jain, this is a web-application which serves :-</p><ul><li>a forum to post and answer questions</li><li>a dashboard to access educational resources subject-wise posted by teachers</li></ul><p>Introducing the concept of a universal LMS - non school-specific LMS catering resources to all students who sign up for the web application, also offering a forum to post, explore, search and answer questions. Offering stream-wise subject selection for students of grades XI and XII, where one can choose their 5 subjects on sign up to access only required resources. These days, with a lot of resources on the internet, it is difficult to collect all and manage between them, hence OneStop combines the best of the best resources - a collection curated by verified teachers for students to access. OneStop also provides a platform where a student, or a teacher, can post, search and access questions, and these questions can be answered by teachers or students. With a very unique back-end structure, we offer a novel one-off service of a "OneStop" - one stop for resources, questions, and educational queries.</p><p>To be specific, we offer specific resources subject-wise and class-wise, past board papers, past school papers, and a specific platform to post and answer questions.</p><p>Currently filled with dummy data, this project has potential to become a world-leading web application very useful to students and teachers.</p>
