# OneStop-Dashboard
Project for Geek-&lt;a />-Hertz 2020 Web Coding Hackathon
Created by Aaditya Rengarajan and Shreya Jain, this is a web-application which serves :-
  - a forum to post and answer questions
  - a dashboard to access educational resources subject-wise posted by teachers
  
Introducing the concept of a universal LMS - non school-specific LMS catering resources to all students who sign up for the web application,
also offering a forum to post, explore, search and answer questions. Offering stream-wise subject selection for students of grades XI and XII,
where one can choose their 5 subjects on sign up to access only required resources.
These days, with a lot of resources on the internet, it is difficult to collect all and manage between them, hence OneStop combines the best of
the best resources - a collection curated by verified teachers for students to access.
OneStop also provides a platform where a student, or a teacher, can post, search and access questions, and these questions can be answered by teachers
or students. With a very unique back-end structure, we offer a novel one-off service of a "OneStop" - one stop for resources, questions, and educational queries.

To be specific, we offer specific resources subject-wise and class-wise, past board papers, past school papers, and a specific platform to post and answer questions.

Currently filled with dummy data, this project has potential to become a world-leading web application very useful to students and teachers.
